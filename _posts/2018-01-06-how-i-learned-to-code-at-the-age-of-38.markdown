## Reasons I started coding
It is all started at the end of 2016. That time I had just completed my upper-intermediate Mandarin course, and I thought: what's next? Then I thought: if I could learn Mandarin, why can't I learn some programming language? I thought: be it a human language or a programming language - it is basically the same thing, just programming languages are more formalised and thus easier.

What is more, I felt like without programming experience I was lacking something as an IT project manager. It was like seeing a half of the picture, and developers seeing another half. But there got to be someone who sees the whole!

But the very main reason why I started programming were my colleagues-developers from [Wego.com](https://www.wego.com) who inspired me. I always wanted to code, but was unconfident and had that weird persuasion that coding is not for women. Even though I have a degree in math and IT, since my graduation 17 years ago I never worked as a programmer.

No sooner said than done, I started coding.


## How I chose Java and Ruby
I did not have any idea what to code and found boring writing some dummy code just for practice. So I started taking some minor tasks from the company's Jira backlog and do them after work. It was mostly one-two lines code updates or bug-fixes. My company's backend was written in Java and Ruby on Rails, so Java became my first language and Ruby a second one.

At the beginning I did not have much understanding of what I was doing, often I was just copy-pasting other's code. There were moments of desperation and anger, when I could not get some programming concept. For example, for a very long time I could not understand the importancy of unit testing and argued with my colleagues that unit tests are useless. Thanks to my colleagues, they were really patient and supportive.

## Books and courses?
From quite a few programmers I heard that they never finished reading any programming books. I tried to read some programming books and to be honest abandoned quite a few of them. But these 2 books fascinated me, so I fully finished them:
- [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](https://www.sandimetz.com/products/) by Sandi Metz
- [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) by Chris Pine

I also took a several courses in [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/users/sergodeeva) - mostly courses related to Ruby, MySQL and Git.

## First hardship
The hardest project I worked on in 2017 was upgrading a RoR app from Rails 4.2.4 to Rails 5. It took me a month of after-work hours (not every day), the first code was commited on 4 July, and a pull request was finally approvied on 4 August:

I did not know it was hard, that is why started working on it enthusiastically. When I realised it was too much of a challenge for me, it was too late, so I had to complete it :) The hardest part was not making the changes, but to make sure my changes did not break anything (that time I understood the importance of good unit tests hahaha).

## 1384 contributions in a year
I ended 2017 with 1384 contributions in GitHub (there were some in Bitbucket too, but I don't count them):

Not bad for a first year of coding, huh?

## What's next?
I am full of doubts. Shall I look for a full-time programmer job? Is there even a chance to get that job for a 38 y.o. person without official programming experience? If I get that job, will I be happy to "start from the bottom"? I really do not know. For now just going with the flow.
